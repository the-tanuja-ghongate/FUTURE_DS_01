📊 FUTURE_DS_01 — Business Sales Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

🔍 Task Overview

This project was completed as part of the Future Interns — Data Science & Analytics Track (DS) internship task.

The objective was to analyze business sales data and build a client-ready analytics dashboard to identify:

Revenue trends over time

Top-selling products

High-value categories

Regional performance

Profit vs Sales relationships

The goal was not just visualization, but generating business insights and actionable recommendations similar to real analyst work.

🛠️ Tools Used

Microsoft Power BI Desktop

Excel / CSV Sales Dataset (Superstore-style dataset)

DAX Measures for KPI calculation

🧹 Data Preparation Steps

Loaded raw sales dataset into Power BI

Fixed incorrect data types (Sales, Profit → Decimal Number)

Cleaned date fields

Verified categorical fields (Category, Region, Segment)

Built calculated measures using DAX

📐 KPI Measures Created

The following business KPIs were created using DAX:

Total Revenue = SUM(Sales)
Total Profit = SUM(Profit)
Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(Order ID)
Total Units Sold = SUM(Quantity)


These KPIs are displayed as top-level dashboard cards.

💡 Key Business Insights

A small number of products contribute a large share of total revenue (Top-10 concentration effect)

Certain categories generate high revenue but comparatively lower profit margins

Regional performance varies significantly — some regions outperform consistently

Sales and profit are positively related, but not uniformly — indicating margin differences

Revenue shows time-based fluctuation patterns useful for forecasting

🚀 Business Recommendations

Focus marketing and inventory on top revenue-generating products

Improve margins in high-sales but low-profit categories

Target underperforming regions with promotional strategies

Use time trend patterns for demand planning

Monitor profit vs sales scatter clusters to detect inefficient product lines
